This repository contains all the necessary code and data files to reproduce the following figure, Figure S4, and S5 of the manuscript. 

Below is Figure 4, which exemplifies the potential of our orthogonal CRISPR system for in vivo recording. Parts C-F can be created using this repository. 

**The basic outline is as follows:**
  1. Identify high-quality CRISPR-induced mutations in barcodes by running the GESTALT pipeline (McKenna et al. 2016)
  2. Process outputs of edited barcodes to generate main and supplemental figures. 

**If you want to generate the figures without spending a lot of time and compute for step 1, skip to section "For generating figures using processed data."
